    <h2>When Are My Children Ready for Swim Lessons?</h2>
    <p>Children can participate in swimming lessons before they can walk! Parent/child swim lessons provide water safety education and bonding opportunities that can last a lifetime.

 

In the years to follow, your child will be prepared to continue swim lessons on their own with an instructor; most lesson providers do not require parents to get in the water beyond the toddler years, however it is strongly encouraged that parents observe their childâ€™s swimming skill development from a designated viewing area.</p>
